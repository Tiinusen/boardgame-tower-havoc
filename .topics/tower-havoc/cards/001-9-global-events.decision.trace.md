# Global Event card set

This artifact records the operative Tower Havoc state for this bounded subject.

## Decision

- State: accepted prototype baseline
- Rule ID: cards.events
- Type: event
- Quantity: 6
- Global Rule: Events affect all players rather than targeting a chosen opponent. Immediate resolution is preferred. A persistent Event remains face-up and expires when the player who drew it begins their next turn.

| Event | Quantity | Effect | Timing |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Ammunition Shortage | 1 | Every player loses 1 Ready Ammo if possible. | Resolve immediately. |
| Production Boom | 1 | Every player who currently has any ammo in Production gains +1 Ready Ammo immediately; Production contents remain unchanged. | Resolve immediately. |
| Panic Production | 1 | Every player immediately chooses: gain 2 Ready Ammo OR gain 1 action. | Resolve immediately. |
| Damp Powder | 1 | No player may use Emergency Ammo until the drawer begins their next turn; Planned Ammo works normally. | Leave face-up until expiry. |
| Ceasefire | 1 | No attacks until the drawer begins their next turn. | Leave face-up until expiry. |
| Building Strike | 1 | All builds cost +1 action until the drawer begins their next turn. | Leave face-up until expiry. |


## Basis

Global events create table-wide state changes without blurring the targeted role of ordinary tactical cards. Expiry anchored to the drawer keeps duration visible and easy to remember.

## Consequences

The deck generator emits one copy of each declared Event. Persistent Event state should be represented by the face-up card itself.
